    "# NLP_04: Removing Stopwords with NLTK in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In natural language processing (NLP), it is often useful to remove commonly occurring words that carry little semantic meaning. These words, called **stopwords**, include articles, prepositions, and pronouns such as *\"the\"*, *\"and\"*, *\"is\"*, and *\"in\"*. While they may seem insignificant, handling stopwords properly can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "| Original Text                                       | Without Stopwords                              |\n",
    "| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| A Computer Science Portal for Geeks | Computer Science, Portal, Geeks |\n",
    "| Can listening be exhausting?                        | Listening, Exhausting                          |\n",
    "| I like reading, so I read                           | Like, Reading, read                            |\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sentence:\n",
    "*\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stopwords:** \"the\", \"over\"\n",
    "* **Content words:** \"quick\", \"brown\", \"fox\", \"jumps\", \"lazy\", \"dog\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing stopwords becomes particularly important when working with large text datasets, as processing high-frequency words can waste computational resources and skew analysis results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Remove Stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision depends on the NLP task:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks that benefit from stopword removal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text classification and sentiment analysis\n",
    "* Information retrieval and search engines\n",
    "* Topic modeling and clustering\n",
    "* Keyword extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks that require keeping stopwords:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine translation (maintains grammatical structure)\n",
    "* Text summarization (preserves sentence coherence)\n",
    "* Question-answering systems (syntactic relationships matter)\n",
    "* Grammar checking and parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "Language modeling is a middle ground: whether to remove stopwords depends on the specific application and computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categories of Stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding different types of stopwords helps make informed decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standard Stopwords:** Common function words like articles (*\"a\"*, *\"the\"*), conjunctions (*\"and\"*, *\"but\"*), and prepositions (*\"in\"*, *\"on\"*).\n",
    "2. **Domain-Specific Stopwords:** Frequently occurring words specific to a field, e.g., *\"patient\"* in medical texts.\n",
    "3. **Contextual Stopwords:** Words that appear very often in a particular dataset.\n",
    "4. **Numerical Stopwords:** Digits, punctuation, or single characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing Stopwords Using NLTK\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) supports stopword removal in **16 languages**. The typical process includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup:** Import NLTK modules and download resources like stopwords and tokenizers.\n",
    "2. **Text Preprocessing:** Convert text to lowercase and tokenize it into words.\n",
    "3. **Stopword Removal:** Load English stopwords and filter them out from the token list.\n",
    "4. **Output:** Compare original and cleaned tokens.\n"
